# SheCodesProject

## Purpose

This was my assessment for my 3 week Introduction to Coding course with SheCodes.io in August 2020. It is a Boba Tea fan page.

## Tech Stack

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

Users see a list of 3 things I love about Boba Tea, and are able to create a custom 4th list item by clicking the button and adding their input (blank responses have been accounted for).

## Deployment

The page is deployed on the SheCodes.io website: https://www.shecodes.io/workshops/shecodes-online-workshop-28-0/projects/80096
